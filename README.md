# AIMA WEBSITE 6

This is the 6th website I built to showcase my skills . In this website I used Jekyll for content management .

This website is built using a jekyll theme , and I made this website in the mission of experimenting with various frameworks .

I explored jekyll it's liquid templating language and found that it can cause conflict with angular.js builds as both use {{}} syntaxes . 

# So , after checking out many possible combinations , I still prefer Hugo due to it's simplicity .
