# AIMA WEBSITE 6

This is the 6th website I built to showcase my skills . In this website I used Jekyll for content management .


I explored jekyll it's liquid templating language and found that it can cause conflict with angular.js builds as both use {{}} syntaxes

Jekyll is a nice static cms . 

## In this website :

- I Uploaded two exercises to show that it supports Mathjax and the workflow style .
- Just making a post in the ```_post``` directory in markdown will cause the server to render the components automatically       using Jekyll's Markdownify 
- Minimalistic style of the theme .
- It can take up to 10 minutes for github to render the webpages .
- Integrated with disqus comment section .
